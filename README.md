# 📝 To-Do List Project

A simple, interactive to-do list built using **vanilla JavaScript**. This app allows users to add tasks with due dates and delete them dynamically. No external libraries or frameworks are required.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks with a name and due date  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks from the list  
- 🔁 Task list updates automatically on changes  
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast — pure JavaScript

## 🧠 How It Works

- All tasks are stored in a JavaScript array (`todoList`).
- The `renderTodoList()` function dynamically displays the task list and sets up delete functionality.
- The `addTodo()` function grabs input values, adds a new task to the list, and refreshes the view.
